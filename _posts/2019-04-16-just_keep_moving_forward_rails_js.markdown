 Now standing on what looks like a finished product for the 4th project, the most meaningful advice that I received was to "Just keep moving forward." Just one line at a time, one function at a time, one idea at a time, things will eventually fall into place. 

Another take away from the project was, if you put in the effort on writing a feature to abstract away as many things as you can it is highly likely that you will be able to reuse some code or pattern. Durring my house_plant project I was able to same myself some extra thinking by not being lazy and making handlebars templates to render plants consisstently.
