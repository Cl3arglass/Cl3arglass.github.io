I find a good way to keep some commits going and to continue a little structured learning is to enjoy some 
of the extra curriculum that Flatiron offers. After graduation you unlock some bonus sections that can help you level up further.

The Computer Science section aids in learning about some more abstract data structures. I've also been putting work into the Node.js section and Swift sections.

Other than that I can recommend Linux Basics: The Command Line Interface on EDX. This class helps in reinforcing some much needed linux commands. They really came in handy when learning how to deploy my projects on AWS.  

For a little more in depth look at Algorithms and Data Structures I would recommend Algorithms part one on Coursera by Princeton. Feels like a real deal college class that is inexplicably free. It has all of your Big 0 notation and code examples you need to feel like you are learning something.

That's all I have for now, I'm sure there is more learning to come.
