Is this the beggining of things 

Why do you ask, is it a bit much.

       You don't have to say 

your talents 

         have looked this way.
				 
		What was your answer
		
		  to the measure of nothingness
			
to the trust in tone

            of afterwards
						
		in the grey light left to revel
		
		         un-well
		
		the ports left over.
		
		
		
		
		
		It feels really good, to leave one life in pursuit of another; to be able to create again. With the completion of the first project that is supposed to be my own, my sense of purpose has been verified. I really have to thank the Flatiron School for having such a great curriculum and modes of support. My first Ruby Gem is truly a success.
